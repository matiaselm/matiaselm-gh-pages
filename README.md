# This app was started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

Current published version of this app can be found [here](https://matiaselm.github.io/matiaselm-gh-pages/)

## How to run

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with npm installed

- Git clone the repo

- From project root type 'npm i' to console

- You need to start a [new firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#config-object) and get it's config data from there for db-communication to work.
  - For storing the config credentials, I recommend using a [.env file](https://medium.com/how-to-react/using-env-file-in-react-js-b2714235e77e)

- After firebase implementation, run the project by typing 'npm start' to console
